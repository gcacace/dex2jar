dex2jar contains following compment
  1. [dex-reader](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/source/browse/#hg%2Fdex-reader) is designed to read the [Dalvik Executable (.dex/.odex) format](http://source.android.com/tech/dalvik/dex-format.html). It has a light weight API similar with [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org). [An example here](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/source/browse/dex-reader/src/main/java/com/googlecode/dex2jar/util/Dump.java)
  1. [dex-translator](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/source/browse/#hg%2Fdex-translator) is designed to do the convert job. It reads the dex instruction to dex-ir format, after some optimize, convert to ASM format.
  1. [dex-ir](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/source/browse/#hg%2Fdex-ir) used by dex-translator, is designed to represent the dex instruction
  1. [dex-tools](http://code.google.com/p/dex2jar/source/browse/#hg%2Fdex-tools) tools to work with .class files. here are examples:
    * [Modify a apk](ModifyApkWithDexTool.md)
    * [DeObfuscate a jar](DeObfuscateJarWithDexTool.md)
  1. d2j-smali `[To be published]` disassemble dex to smali files and assemble dex from smali files. different implementation to smali/baksmali, same syntax, but we support escape in type desc "Lcom/dex2jar\t\u1234;"
  1. dex-writer `[To be published]` write dex same way as dex-reader.
